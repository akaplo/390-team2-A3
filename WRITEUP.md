## Team 2 - Aaron Kaplowitz, Todd Morse, Dan Snyder

1. We each collected our data individually.  

  Aaron did his collection on his couch over the course of a few sessions, varying the noise in the room each time.  One was when he was home alone, thus the room was silent.  Another was when others were home having conversations in the background, and a third was the sound of others cooking in the background, along with the television being on.  He talked approximately 1-2 feet away from the microphone.

  Dan did his data collection in a crowded CS USpace.  There was a varying amount of background noise as some groups got louder and quieter over the course of the few minutes that data was being collected. He talked approximately 3 inches away from the microphone.

  Where did Todd do his?

2. In addition to being used to find patterns in speech and infer habits over time (the example from the Background section), speaker analytics can also be used (with the addition of a properly trained classifier) to determine someone's current mood based on their speech.  This could then be applied to determining how people react to certain situations and stimuli.

3. Even assuming perfect speech-to-text, the algorithm would still only be considering a few words or sentences.  We'd lose an enormous amount of context; perhaps if the window was over an essay's worth of speech, the recognition would work a little better.  The question also essentially describes a "bag of words" representation, so the algorithm would have no awareness of word order.

4. Yes, thanks Erik!
